2.Research and find how the values of ArrayList are stored in the memory?
.The elements of an ArrayList are stored in a chunk of contiguous memory
.When that memory becomes full,a larger chunk of contiguous memory has to be allocated
.and the existing elements are copied into this new chunk
.We call this chunk the capacity of the ArrayList object 

3.What are the Dis-advantages of ArrayList(Collections ArrayList)
.The non-generic collection classes such as ArrayList,Stack,Queue,Hashtable,etc operate on the object data type
.As they operator on object data type hence they are loosely typed
.Loosely typed means you can store any type of value into the collection

5.In a tabular format Write the differences between Collections and generics?
1.namespace:
Collections:
->In Collections the namespace has ArrayList,Hashtable,Queue
generics:
->In generic the namespace has CollectionExtensions,SortedDictionary<Tkey,TValue>
2.Each element is of what type:
Collections:
->Collections are enhancement to the arrays.
->The standard Collections are found under the Sysytem.Collections.
->They do not store elements as specifically typed objects,but as objects of type Object.
generics:
->generic is a class which allows the user to define classes and methods with the placeholder. 
->generics were added to version 2.0 of the C# language.
->The basic idea behind using generic is to allow type(Integer,String,...etc and user-defined types)to be a parameter to methods,classes,and interfaces.
3.do you need type casting here:
Collections:
->When the variable of one data type is changed to another data type is known as Type Casting.
->According to our needs,we can change the type of data.
->At the time of the compilation,C# is a statically-typed i.e., after the declaration of the variable,we cannot declare it again.
generics:
->
